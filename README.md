# Node Workshop
The following repository contains code written at the workshops.

In order to install the packages on you machine, you would need to type the command "npm install" on terminal or command prompt. This will install all the necessary packages or dependencies that are required by your project.

## Week 1
The primary focus of the first workshop was to give students a brief overview of what Node is and where and how it is used. This was accompanied by getting them started by downloading required software. Topics covered in this workshop include:

* Housekeeping
* Basics of JavaScript
* let, const instead of var
* Arrays and objects
* Modules and the require keyword
